# FullStack-part3
Phonebook app back-end, using NodeJS, express, nodemon, morgan </br>
Then frontend was added too (build), made it with React </br>
Simple app, it was my first time building something with both front-end and back-end using MERN stack :)
The full app is hosted on heroku and available here: https://nameless-badlands-31312.herokuapp.com/
